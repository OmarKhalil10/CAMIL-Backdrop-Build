                Medical images are used in many therapeutic areas and contain a goldmine of information.
                 Part of this information is traditionally extracted by radiologists and with the advances made in image processing
                  and artificial intelligence, computers are now able to go deeper in the extraction of almost every detail which is hidden in the image. In clinical trials, 
                  centralized and automated analysis of medical images allow the removal of human-induced variability and bias. 
                  Thanks to our extensive experience in handling medical imaging variability, applying AI and trial statistics, and working with pharma companies, 
                  our goal is to position Radiomics as the next generation imaging CRO. For this, Radiomics provides a full package of services.
                  so our medical image Laboratory will help ill people to discover the illness early.

          <h5>What is AI?</h5>
          <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
          <p>
            Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science
             which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn,
              gradually improving its accuracy.Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through the use of statistical methods,
               algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, and to uncover key insights in data mining projects.

          <h3>Computer Vision is closely related to Machine Learning</h3>
          <p>
            Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs â€” 
            and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.

            Computer vision works much the same as human vision, except humans have a head start. Human sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart,
             how far away they are, whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image.

                      The first symptoms of COVID-19 and influenza (flu) infections are often very similar. They both cause fever and similar respiratory symptoms, which can then range from mild through to severe disease, and sometimes can be fatal.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                      Both viruses are also transmitted in the same way, by coughing or sneezing, or by contact with hands, surfaces or objects contaminated with the virus. As a result, the same public health measures, such as hand hygiene (hand washing), good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue) and good household cleaning are important actions to prevent both infections.
                    </p><br>
                    <p> 
                      The speed of transmission is an important difference between the two viruses. Influenza typically has a shorter incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) than COVID-19. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19.
                    </p><br>
                    <p> 
                      While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be higher for COVID-19. While most people have mild symptoms, approximately 15% of people have severe infections and 5% require intensive care in a hospital ICU. The proportions of severe and critical COVID-19 infections are higher than for influenza infections.

                      We know that the disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads between people in several different ways.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                      - Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, for example at a conversational distance. The virus can spread from an infected personâ€™s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. Another person can then contract the virus when infectious particles that pass through the air are inhaled at short range (this is often called short-range aerosol or short-range airborne transmission) or if infectious particles come into direct contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth (droplet transmission).
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                      - The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is because aerosols can remain suspended in the air or travel farther than conversational distance (this is often called long-range aerosol or long-range airborne transmission).
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                      - People may also become infected when touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus.
