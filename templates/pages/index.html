          Our goal is with our AI diagnoses system is to assist doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers
           in their daily work .... because AI in healthcare can enhance preventive care and quality of life,
            produce more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans, and lead to better patient outcomes overall. 
            AI can also predict and track the spread of infectious diseases by analyzing data from a government,
             healthcare, and other sources. As a result, AI can play a crucial role in global public health 
          as a tool for combatting epidemics and pandemics.

              <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
              <p>
                Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science
                which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn,
                  gradually improving its accuracy.Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through the use of statistical methods,
                  algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, and to uncover key insights in data mining projects.

              <h3>Computer Vision is closely related to Machine Learning</h3>
              <p>
                Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — 
                and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.

                Computer vision works much the same as human vision, except humans have a head start. Human sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart,
                how far away they are, whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image.

              Some details about how the disease is spread are unknown and
              is being determined.The WHO and CDC state that it is
              primarily spread during close contact and by respiratory
              droplets produced when people cough or sneeze; with close
              contact being within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet). A study in
              Singapore found that an uncovered coughing can lead to
              droplets travelling up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).

            <p>
              Respiratory droplets may also be produced during breathing
              out, including when talking, though the virus is not
              generally airborne. These droplets can land in the mouths or
              noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into
              the lungs. Some medical procedures such as intubation and

            <h4>What are coronaviruses?</h4>
            <p>
              The first symptoms of COVID-19 and influenza (flu)
              infections are often very similar. They both cause fever and
              similar respiratory symptoms, which can then range from mild
              through to severe disease, and sometimes can be fatal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both viruses are also transmitted in the same way, by
              coughing or sneezing, or by contact with hands, surfaces or
              objects contaminated with the virus. As a result, the same
              public health measures, such as hand hygiene (hand washing),
              good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into

              The speed of transmission is an important difference between

              incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of

              spread faster than COVID-19.

              While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar,
              the fraction with severe disease appears to be higher for
              COVID-19. While most people have mild symptoms,
              approximately 15% of people have severe infections and 5%
              require intensive care in a hospital ICU. The proportions of
              severe and critical COVID-19 infections are higher than for
              influenza infections.

              objects contaminated with the virus. As a result, the same
              public health measures, such as hand hygiene (hand washing),
              good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into
              a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue) and good
              household cleaning are important actions to prevent both

              The speed of transmission is an important difference between
              the two viruses. Influenza typically has a shorter
              incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of
              symptoms) than COVID-19. This means that influenza can
              spread faster than COVID-19.

            <p>
              While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar,
              the fraction with severe disease appears to be higher for
              COVID-19. While most people have mild symptoms,
              approximately 15% of people have severe infections and 5%
              require intensive care in a hospital ICU. The proportions of
              severe and critical COVID-19 infections are higher than for
              influenza infections.

              the two viruses. Influenza typically has a shorter
              incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of
              symptoms) than COVID-19. This means that influenza can
              spread faster than COVID-19.

              While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar,
              the fraction with severe disease appears to be higher for
              COVID-19. While most people have mild symptoms,
              approximately 15% of people have severe infections and 5%
              require intensive care in a hospital ICU. The proportions of
              severe and critical COVID-19 infections are higher than for
              influenza infections.

              Both viruses are also transmitted in the same way, by
              coughing or sneezing, or by contact with hands, surfaces or
              objects contaminated with the virus. As a result, the same
              public health measures, such as hand hygiene (hand washing),
              good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into
              a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue) and good
              household cleaning are important actions to prevent both
              infections.

              The speed of transmission is an important difference between
              the two viruses. Influenza typically has a shorter
              incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of
              symptoms) than COVID-19. This means that influenza can
              spread faster than COVID-19.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar,
              the fraction with severe disease appears to be higher for
              COVID-19. While most people have mild symptoms,
              approximately 15% of people have severe infections and 5%
              require intensive care in a hospital ICU. The proportions of
              severe and critical COVID-19 infections are higher than for
              influenza infections.

              The first symptoms of COVID-19 and influenza (flu)
              infections are often very similar. They both cause fever and
              similar respiratory symptoms, which can then range from mild
              through to severe disease, and sometimes can be fatal.
