          هدفنا هو مساعدة الأطباء والممرضات والعاملين في مجال الرعاية الصحية من خلال نظام التشخيص بالذكاء الاصطناعي
          لأن استخدام الذكاء الاصطناعي في الرعاية الصحية يمكن أن يعزز الرعاية الوقائية ونوعية الحياة ،
          ومن خلال إنتاج تشخيصات وخطط علاج أكثر دقة ، وتؤدي إلى نتائج أفضل للمرضى بشكل عام.
          يمكن للذكاء الاصطناعي أيضًا التنبؤ وتتبع انتشار الأمراض المعدية من خلال تحليل البيانات والمعلومات المختلفة
          . نتيجة لذلك ، يمكن للذكاء الاصطناعي أن يلعب دورًا حاسمًا في الصحة العامة العالمية
          كأداة لمكافحة الأوبئة

              <h2>ما هو التعلم الألى؟</h2>
              <p>
                التعلم الآلي هو فرع من فروع الذكاء الاصطناعي وعلوم الكمبيوتر الذي يركز على استخدام البيانات
                والخوارزميات لتقليد الطريقة التي يتعلم بها البشر ، وتحسين دقتها تدريجيًا ، والتعلم الآلي هو عنصر مهم في
                المجال المتنامي لعلوم البيانات. من خلال استخدام الأساليب الإحصائية ،
                يتم تدريب الخوارزميات على إجراء تصنيفات أو تنبؤات ، وكشف الأفكار الرئيسية في مشاريع التنقيب عن البيانات

              <h3>يرتبط رؤية الكمبيوتر ارتباطًا وثيقًا بالتعلم الالي</h3>
              <p>
                رؤية الكمبيوتر هي أحد مجالات الذكاء الاصطناعي التي تمكن أجهزة الكمبيوتر والأنظمة من استخلاص معلومات
                ذات مغزى من الصور الرقمية ومقاطع الفيديو والمدخلات المرئية الأخرى - واتخاذ إجراءات أو تقديم توصيات بناءً
                على تلك المعلومات. إذا كان الذكاء الاصطناعي يمكّن أجهزة الكمبيوتر من التفكير ، فإن رؤية الكمبيوتر تمكنهم
                من الرؤية والملاحظة والفهم ، وتعمل رؤية الكمبيوتر بنفس الطريقة التي تعمل بها الرؤية البشرية ، باستثناء
                أن البشر لديهم السبق. يتمتع البصر البشري بميزة عمر السياق لتدريبه على كيفية تمييز الأشياء عن بعضها ،
                ومدى بُعدها ، وما إذا كانت تتحرك وما إذا كان هناك خطأ ما في الصورة

              Some details about how the disease is spread are unknown and

              droplets produced when people cough or sneeze; with close
              contact being within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet). A study in
              Singapore found that an uncovered coughing can lead to
              droplets travelling up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).

              out, including when talking, though the virus is not
              generally airborne. These droplets can land in the mouths or
              noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into

              The first symptoms of COVID-19 and influenza (flu)
              infections are often very similar. They both cause fever and
              similar respiratory symptoms, which can then range from mild
              through to severe disease, and sometimes can be fatal.

              Both viruses are also transmitted in the same way, by
              coughing or sneezing, or by contact with hands, surfaces or
              objects contaminated with the virus. As a result, the same
              public health measures, such as hand hygiene (hand washing),
              good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into
              a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue) and good
              household cleaning are important actions to prevent both

              The speed of transmission is an important difference between

              incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of
              symptoms) than COVID-19. This means that influenza can
              spread faster than COVID-19.

            <p>
              While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar,
              the fraction with severe disease appears to be higher for
              COVID-19. While most people have mild symptoms,
              approximately 15% of people have severe infections and 5%
              require intensive care in a hospital ICU. The proportions of
              severe and critical COVID-19 infections are higher than for
              influenza infections.

              What is the difference between COVID-19 and the flu? 3
            </h4>
            <p>
              The first symptoms of COVID-19 and influenza (flu)
              infections are often very similar. They both cause fever and
              similar respiratory symptoms, which can then range from mild
              through to severe disease, and sometimes can be fatal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both viruses are also transmitted in the same way, by
              coughing or sneezing, or by contact with hands, surfaces or
              objects contaminated with the virus. As a result, the same
              public health measures, such as hand hygiene (hand washing),
              good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into
              a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue) and good
              household cleaning are important actions to prevent both
              infections.
            </p>
            <p>
              The speed of transmission is an important difference between
              the two viruses. Influenza typically has a shorter
              incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of
              symptoms) than COVID-19. This means that influenza can
              spread faster than COVID-19.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar,
              the fraction with severe disease appears to be higher for
              COVID-19. While most people have mild symptoms,
              approximately 15% of people have severe infections and 5%
              require intensive care in a hospital ICU. The proportions of
              severe and critical COVID-19 infections are higher than for
              influenza infections.

              1- Students benefit from in-person learning, and safely returning to in-person instruction continues to be a priority.
            </p>
            <p>
              2- Vaccination is the leading public health prevention strategy to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Promoting vaccination can help schools safely return to in-person learning as well as extracurricular activities and sports.
            </p>
            <p>
              3- Students, teachers, and staff should stay home when they have signs of any infectious illness and be referred to their healthcare provider for testing and care.
            </p>
            <p>
              4- This guidance emphasizes implementing layered prevention strategies to protect students, teachers, staff, visitors, and other members of their households and support in-person learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              5- Localities should monitor community transmission, vaccination coverage, screening testing, and occurrence of outbreaks to guide decisions on the level of layered prevention strategies (e.g., physical distancing, screening testing).

            <h4>How is the virus spread? 4</h4>
            <p>
              The first symptoms of COVID-19 and influenza (flu)
              infections are often very similar. They both cause fever and
              similar respiratory symptoms, which can then range from mild
              through to severe disease, and sometimes can be fatal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both viruses are also transmitted in the same way, by
              coughing or sneezing, or by contact with hands, surfaces or
              objects contaminated with the virus. As a result, the same
              public health measures, such as hand hygiene (hand washing),
              good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into
              a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue) and good
              household cleaning are important actions to prevent both
              infections.
            </p>
            <p>
              The speed of transmission is an important difference between
              the two viruses. Influenza typically has a shorter
              incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of
              symptoms) than COVID-19. This means that influenza can
              spread faster than COVID-19.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar,
              the fraction with severe disease appears to be higher for
              COVID-19. While most people have mild symptoms,
              approximately 15% of people have severe infections and 5%
              require intensive care in a hospital ICU. The proportions of
              severe and critical COVID-19 infections are higher than for
              influenza infections.
